![](media/closeup.jpg)

## Workshop Goals
- Introduce participants to Arduino and its capabilities
- Teach the basics of programming and electronics
- Enable participants to build prototypes for creative purposes
- Explore creative ways of using Arduino for exhibits

## Workshop Agenda

1. Introduction to Arduino (20 min)
    - What is Arduino?
    - What is a micro-controller?
    - inputs and outputs
    - digital vs. analog
    - basics of electricity (URI, parallel vs. serial)

2. Example 1: Arduino Programming Basics (30 mins)
    - Setting up the Arduino IDE
    - Understanding the Arduino programming language
    - Writing and uploading your first Arduino sketch

3. Example 2: Interfacing the real world (40 mins)
    - Digital and analog I/O    
    - Using the breadboard
    - Working with variables and data types
    - Measuring & Controlling (LEDs, Resistors)
    - Serial communication with the Computer

4. break (15 minutes)

5. Building a prototype: OSC to stepper motor (1h 40mins)
    - stepper motor & driver
    - schematic
    - providing external power
    - controlling the stepper


## Hardware Requirements
- Computer
- USB cable for connecting Arduino to the computer
- Arduino ([compatible board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Arduino_boards_and_compatible_systems))
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- Example 2: 
    - potentiometer
    - LED
- Prototype:
    - Nema 17 stepper Motor
    - L298n motor driver


## Workshop Duration
The workshop is designed to be completed in 4 hours, including hands-on activities and project development.
