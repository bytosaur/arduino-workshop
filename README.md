![](media/closeup.jpg)

## Workshop Goals
- Introduce participants to Arduino and its capabilities
- Teach the basics of programming and electronics
- Enable participants to build prototypes
- Explore creative ways of using Arduino for exhibits
- Build a prototype for creative purposes


## Workshop Agenda

1. Introduction to Arduino (15 min)
    - What is Arduino?
    - What is a micro-controller?
    - inputs and outputs
    - digital vs. analog
    - basics of electricity (URI, parallel vs. serial)

2. Example 1: Arduino Programming Basics (30 mins)
    - Setting up the Arduino IDE
    - Understanding the Arduino programming language
    - Writing and uploading your first Arduino sketch
    - Working with variables, data types, and control structures

3. Hardware Components (10 mins)
    - electronic components (diodes, capacitors, transistors)
    - advanced components (ICs, board, sensors, and motors)
    - Using the breadboard

4. break (10 minutes)

4. Example 2: Interfacing the real world (40 mins)
    - Digital and analog I/O
    - Measuring & Controlling (LEDs, Resistors)
    - Serial communication with the Computer

5. Building a prototype: OSC to stepper motor (1h 20mins)
    - the stepper motor
    - installing a library
    - the hardware patch (common ground, )
    - controlling the stepper



## Workshop Requirements
- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno, Arduino Nano)
- USB cable for connecting Arduino to the computer
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- Basic electronic components (e.g., resistors, LEDs, sensors)
- Computer with Arduino IDE installed

## Workshop Duration
The workshop is designed to be completed in 4 hours, including hands-on activities and project development.
